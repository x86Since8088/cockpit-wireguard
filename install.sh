# install.sh - in-place install of cockpit-wireguard, BY SYMLINK.
#
#   sudo ./install.sh                 install from wherever this script is
#   sudo ./install.sh --with-units    also render the systemd unit (dev only)
#   sudo ./install.sh --uninstall     remove the links and the units
#   sudo DESTDIR=/tmp/x ./install.sh  stage every destination under /tmp/x
#
# THE ONE IDEA
#   This script does not copy the payload. It links the payload's files into the
#   places Cockpit and the shell expect, FROM WHEREVER IT IS BEING RUN. Run it
#   from the dev checkout and the Cockpit page is a set of symlinks into the
#   checkout, so editing wgclient.js changes what the browser loads on the next
#   reload. Run the identical script from /opt/cockpit-wireguard/payload and the
#   links point at a tree with no relationship to the share. The script is the
#   same; only where it is run from differs. Nothing below branches on which of
#   the two it is in order to decide WHAT to link - it branches only to RECORD
#   which it did, in /etc/cockpit-wireguard/install.conf.
#
#   deploy.sh is the other half: it is the only thing that copies, it seeds the
#   .env, and it is the only thing that enables a unit.
#
# WHAT IT TOUCHES
#   /usr/share/cockpit/wireguard/*        symlinks, one per PAGE entry
#   /usr/local/sbin/{wg-admin,...}        symlinks, one per HELPERS entry
#   /etc/wireguard/routing-policy.json    seeded MISSING-ONLY, never clobbered
#   /etc/systemd/system/wg-policy-watch.service   rendered from systemd/*.in
#   /etc/cockpit-wireguard/install.conf   what this run did, for the next reader
#
#   It never restarts cockpit.socket. Cockpit is live at https://localhost:9090
#   and rescans its package directory when a session starts; a page reload is
#   enough, a logout/login only for a changed menu entry.

# deploy.sh writes <install path>/payload-<version>/ and points a sibling
# `payload` symlink at it; swapping that symlink IS an upgrade or rollback, so
# this is a DEPLOYED payload exactly when our own directory is what that
# symlink resolves to. A checkout has no such symlink.
#
# This replaces an older `$SRC == $DEV_ROOT/*` test that named the share
# literally and got a checkout ANYWHERE ELSE wrong: it called itself
# `deployed`, skipping the group-writable warning, recording
# INSTALL_KIND=deployed for a host that was not self-sustaining, and dropping
# "the checkout is NOT touched" from --uninstall. Layout cannot drift when a
# tree moves, and it leaves no dev-root literal here - which is why check 9
# now scans this installer too, with no carve-out.
# NB: computed from $SRC, never from $ROOT - in some of these installers ROOT
# is derived FROM KIND, so reading it here would be a use-before-assignment
# that silently classified every deployed payload as `dev`.
# Two ways to be a deployed payload. The first is the normal one: the `payload`
# alias points at us. The second covers a PREVIOUS payload being run directly -
