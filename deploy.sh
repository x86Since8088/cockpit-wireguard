# WHAT THIS IS, AND WHAT install.sh IS
#   This is the only thing that COPIES. It copies the declared payload - a
#   subset, never the checkout - into [install path]/payload-<version>/, seeds
#   the .env, swaps a symlink, and then runs install.sh FROM THE INSTALL PATH.
#   install.sh does the linking, and it is the same script either way.
#
#   Self-contained on purpose: this repository is cloned on its own, so a deploy
#   script that reached for a shared framework outside the clone would not run.
#
# WHAT SURVIVES
#   .env, /etc/wireguard (peer keys, client configs, the routing policy) and the
#   previous payload. An upgrade replaces payload-<version>/ wholesale and
#   touches nothing else; that split is why .env is a SIBLING of payload/ and not
#   a child of it.
#
# Normative reference: cockpit-secrets/source/docs/DEPLOY-CONTRACT.md.
