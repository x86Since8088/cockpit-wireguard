# Changelog

## 1.1.1 - 2026-09-07

Install classification is now decided by LAYOUT, not by a development-root path
prefix, and this plugin was deployed to its real install path on edt1.

- `install.sh` decides dev vs deployed by asking whether its own directory is
  what a sibling `payload` symlink resolves to. The old test compared `$SRC`
  against a hardcoded development root and got a checkout sitting ANYWHERE ELSE
  wrong: such a checkout classified itself `deployed`, so it skipped the
  group-writable warning, wrote INSTALL_KIND=deployed for a host that was not
  self-sustaining, and dropped "the checkout is not touched" from
  `--uninstall`. Reproduced before the change and confirmed fixed after.
- Because that literal is gone, pre-flight check 9 now scans `install.sh`
  itself. The carve-out that exempted it is removed. Both of the check's own
  patterns are split so the scanner cannot match itself; the string it searches
  for is unchanged, so nothing is weakened.
- `owned_by_us` recognises a dev link by `$SRC` rather than by "anywhere
  under the development root", which is tighter: it no longer adopts a link
  belonging to a different checkout of the same project.
- The uninstall notice and the dev warning ask the LINK TARGET's layout, so
  they stay correct when the deployed installer tears down links a dev install
  made.
- The self-sustaining assertion is stated positively: every link must resolve
  INSIDE the install path, rather than merely "not into the development share".
  That needs no path literal and is strictly stronger - a link into any other
  foreign tree fails it too. Unit paths must be inside the install path or on an
  FHS system prefix, so `ExecStart=/bin/sh -c ...` stays legal.
- wg-admin, wg-admin-package, wg-policy and wg-policy-watch are installed by the
  installer that declares them; deployed and verified on edt1.
A recursive grep of the deployed tree for the development root or the retired
checkout path now returns nothing at all.
